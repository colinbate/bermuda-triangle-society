                    The Bermuda Triangle Society is dedicated to providing a
                    welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for
                    everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability,
                    ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of reading
                    experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
                    religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

                    Expected Behavior
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be welcoming and inclusive.</strong> Use language
                        that's accessible to newcomers. Not everyone has read the
                        same books you have—that's the point!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Respect different opinions.</strong> Someone might
                        love a book you hated (or vice versa). That's what makes discussions
                        interesting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be mindful of spoilers.</strong> Keep pitches spoiler-light.
                        If you need to discuss plot details, give a clear warning
                        first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Listen as much as you speak.</strong> Make space for
                        quieter members to share their thoughts too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Give content warnings when appropriate.</strong> If
                        a book deals with heavy topics, mention that in your pitch
                        so others can make informed choices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Respect people's time.</strong> Keep your pitches
                        to the suggested length so everyone gets a chance to share.

                    A Note on Book Content
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Science fiction and fantasy often explore challenging
                    themes—that's part of what makes the genre so powerful. We
                    don't restrict what books you can pitch, but we ask that
                    you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Provide content warnings for books with heavy themes
                    </li>
                    <li>Be thoughtful in how you discuss sensitive topics</li>
                    <li>Respect that not every book is for every reader</li>
                </ul>

                    In the Spirit of the Genre
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best speculative fiction expands our empathy by showing
                    us lives and perspectives different from our own. Let's
                    bring that same spirit of curiosity and openness to our
                    discussions—exploring new ideas together, even when we
                    disagree.
