Living on an island in the Atlantic, we know the sea holds secrets. This month, we're diving into stories where the ocean is more than just a backdrop—it's a force of nature, a source of mystery, and sometimes, a hungry void that swallows ships whole.

## What fits this theme?

- Shipwreck survival stories
- Underwater civilizations (mermaids, Atlantis, etc.)
- Nautical horror and deep-sea terrors
- Stories about mysterious disappearances at sea
- Submarine or underwater base sci-fi
- Pirate adventures with fantastical elements
- Climate fiction with rising seas

## The Bermuda Triangle connection

We couldn't resist! While we're not requiring Triangle-specific stories (they're surprisingly rare in fiction), any tale of unexplained oceanic phenomena definitely qualifies. If you find a good one, we want to hear about it!

## Content notes

Many ocean stories involve drowning, isolation, and claustrophobic situations. If that's not your jam, look for the more adventurous, swashbuckling end of the spectrum.

## What to bring

- A book or audiobook that fits the theme (if you have one!)
- A 2-3 minute pitch: what's it about, did it work for you, who would you recommend it to?
- Your ideas for future themes

## Can't finish a book in time?

No worries! You're welcome to come just to listen and discover new reads. That's the whole point of Theme League—no homework pressure.

## First time?

We'd love to have you! Check out our [About page](/about) to learn how meetings work. The short version: show up, listen to recommendations, maybe share one of your own, and vote on what we'll read next month.

See you at the library! 📚🌊
