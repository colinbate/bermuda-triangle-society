We've all read those magic systems where everything works perfectly and the hero masters their power just in time. But what about when it doesn't? This theme celebrates the spectacular failures, the oops-I-accidentally-summoned-a-demon moments, and the "well, that escalated quickly" school of magical mishaps.

## What fits this theme?

- Spells with unintended side effects
- Magical experiments gone awry
- Characters who are *bad* at magic
- Systems where magic has a cost that comes due at the worst time
- Curses, corrupted artifacts, and forbidden knowledge
- Humorous fantasy where nothing goes according to plan

## Discussion highlights

Our group particularly loved the contrast between cozy chaos (like *A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking*) and darker takes on magical consequences. Several members noted that the best "gone wrong" stories use the failures to reveal character—how someone handles disaster tells you more than how they handle success.

## Meeting Recap

A wonderful end-of-year gathering with hot cocoa and cookies! We had ten members join us for our final meeting of 2024.

### Highlights

**A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking** was the surprise hit of the evening—four members had read it and couldn't stop laughing about Bob the sourdough starter. The discussion about how Kingfisher uses humor to address serious themes (like child soldiers and political corruption) was particularly engaging.

**The Magicians** sparked a lively debate about whether Quentin is intentionally unlikeable or just poorly written (we landed on "intentionally," but it was close). Several members appreciated how the book deconstructs the "chosen one" narrative.

### Voted Theme

**"AI & Androids"** won the vote for January! We're excited to explore stories about artificial minds and what makes us human.

### Looking Ahead

Thank you all for a fantastic first year of the Bermuda Triangle Society! We can't wait to see what books 2025 brings us.
