From Asimov's Three Laws to modern explorations of machine consciousness, stories about artificial intelligence ask us to examine what it truly means to be alive, to feel, to have a soul.

## What fits this theme?

- Stories where AI or android characters grapple with identity
- Robot uprisings (sympathetic or otherwise)
- Human-AI relationships and friendships
- Philosophical explorations of consciousness
- Cyberpunk tales of uploaded minds

## Discussion sparks

- Do you think AI characters work better as mirrors for humanity or as truly alien minds?
- Which book made you most question the nature of consciousness?
- Are there any "evil AI" stories that actually gave the AI a point?

## Meeting Recap

A fantastic turnout for our first meeting of the year! We had twelve members join us, including three newcomers who found us through the library's events calendar.

### Highlights

The **Murderbot Diaries** was the clear crowd favorite—five different members had read at least the first book, and the discussion about antisocial protagonists in sci-fi got quite lively. One member made an excellent point about how Murderbot's desire to just watch TV shows is actually a profound commentary on finding comfort and identity through media.

**Klara and the Sun** sparked a great debate about whether Ishiguro's AI narrator is truly conscious or just a very good simulation of consciousness. We didn't reach a conclusion (shocking, we know), but everyone agreed the prose was gorgeous.

### Voted Theme

After much deliberation, **"Lost at Sea"** won the vote for February! Very fitting for our island home. Runner-up was "Time Loops" which we're saving for a future meeting.

### New Members Welcome

A special welcome to Sarah, Marcus, and Devon who joined us this month! We hope you'll come back and share your "Lost at Sea" picks with us.
