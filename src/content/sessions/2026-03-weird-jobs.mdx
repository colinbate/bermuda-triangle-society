Whether it is noteworthy characters doing mundane jobs or normal people in unusual roles, there are many tales of non-standard workplaces out there.

## What fits this theme?

- Supernatural creatures performing normal, mundane jobs
- Normal people in unusual or dangerous work environments
- Strange co-worker—is your boss an alien?
- Quests/contracts/gigs that turn out to be more than bargained for

Fantasy, science fiction, superheroes or anything in between. If it stretches the imagination, it will be discussed by the Society.

## First meeting!

This will be our first meeting of the Bermuda Triangle Society. As such, things may be a bit hectic as we attempt to find our footing. Don't worry if you haven't read anything "on theme", as it is just a suggestion in case you are looking for ideas.

If you are interested in helping out in any way with the Society, then email Colin at <a href="mailto:archivist@bermudatrianglesociety.com">archivist@bermudatrianglesociety.com</a>

See you at the library!
