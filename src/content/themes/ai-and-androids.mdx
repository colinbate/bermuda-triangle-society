From Asimov's Three Laws to modern explorations of machine consciousness, stories about artificial intelligence ask us to examine what it truly means to be alive, to feel, to have a soul.

## What fits this theme?

- Stories where AI or android characters grapple with identity
- Robot uprisings (sympathetic or otherwise)
- Human-AI relationships and friendships
- Philosophical explorations of consciousness
- Cyberpunk tales of uploaded minds

## Discussion sparks

- Do you think AI characters work better as mirrors for humanity or as truly alien minds?
- Which book made you most question the nature of consciousness?
- Are there any "evil AI" stories that actually gave the AI a point?
