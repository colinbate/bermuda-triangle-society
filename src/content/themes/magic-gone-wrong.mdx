We've all read those magic systems where everything works perfectly and the hero masters their power just in time. But what about when it doesn't? This theme celebrates the spectacular failures, the oops-I-accidentally-summoned-a-demon moments, and the "well, that escalated quickly" school of magical mishaps.

## What fits this theme?

- Spells with unintended side effects
- Magical experiments gone awry
- Characters who are *bad* at magic
- Systems where magic has a cost that comes due at the worst time
- Curses, corrupted artifacts, and forbidden knowledge
- Humorous fantasy where nothing goes according to plan

## Discussion highlights

Our group particularly loved the contrast between cozy chaos (like *A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking*) and darker takes on magical consequences. Several members noted that the best "gone wrong" stories use the failures to reveal character—how someone handles disaster tells you more than how they handle success.
