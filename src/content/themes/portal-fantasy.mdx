## What fits this theme?

Any story where a character travels—intentionally or not—from one world to another fundamentally different one. Think:

- **Classic portal tales** like Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, or The Wizard of Oz
- **Modern takes** that subvert or examine the trope
- **Isekai** (the anime/manga tradition of being transported to another world)
- **Bermuda Triangle stories** where people vanish into... somewhere else 👀

## What we're looking for

- The *transition* between worlds matters
- The new world should feel meaningfully different
- Bonus points for examining what happens when (if?) characters return

## Not quite a fit

- Secondary world fantasy where we just *start* in another world (like Lord of the Rings)
- Time travel alone doesn't count (unless you're traveling to a whole different reality)
- Parallel universe stories *might* work if there's a clear crossing moment
