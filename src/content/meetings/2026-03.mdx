Join us as we tumble through doorways, wardrobes, and rabbit holes into our **Portal Fantasy** theme!

## What to bring

A book or audiobook that fits the portal fantasy theme—stories where characters travel from one world to a fundamentally different one. Check out the [theme page](/themes/portal-fantasy) for the starter list if you need inspiration.

Not sure what to read? Come anyway! Half the fun is hearing about books from fellow members and adding to your TBR pile.

## Location

We meet at the **Bermuda National Library** in the main meeting room. Street parking is available on Queen Street.

## Can't make it?

No worries! Check the theme page after the meeting—we'll post all the recommendations that come up during discussion.
