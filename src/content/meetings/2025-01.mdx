## Meeting Recap

A fantastic turnout for our first meeting of the year! We had twelve members join us, including three newcomers who found us through the library's events calendar.

### Highlights

The **Murderbot Diaries** was the clear crowd favorite—five different members had read at least the first book, and the discussion about antisocial protagonists in sci-fi got quite lively. One member made an excellent point about how Murderbot's desire to just watch TV shows is actually a profound commentary on finding comfort and identity through media.

**Klara and the Sun** sparked a great debate about whether Ishiguro's AI narrator is truly conscious or just a very good simulation of consciousness. We didn't reach a conclusion (shocking, we know), but everyone agreed the prose was gorgeous.

### Voted Theme

After much deliberation, **"Lost at Sea"** won the vote for February! Very fitting for our island home. Runner-up was "Time Loops" which we're saving for a future meeting.

### New Members Welcome

A special welcome to Sarah, Marcus, and Devon who joined us this month! We hope you'll come back and share your "Lost at Sea" picks with us.
