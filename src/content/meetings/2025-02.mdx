Join us as we dive into the depths with our **Lost at Sea** theme! Whether you've read a kraken horror, a submarine thriller, or a cozy shipwreck romance, we want to hear about it.

## What to bring

- A book or audiobook that fits the theme (if you have one!)
- A 2-3 minute pitch: what's it about, did it work for you, who would you recommend it to?
- Your ideas for future themes

## Can't finish a book in time?

No worries! You're welcome to come just to listen and discover new reads. That's the whole point of Theme League—no homework pressure.

## First time?

We'd love to have you! Check out our [About page](/about) to learn how meetings work. The short version: show up, listen to recommendations, maybe share one of your own, and vote on what we'll read next month.

See you at the library! 📚🌊
